# BeamJoy-Sandbox

This mod is a more refined version of the vanilla BeamMP (sandbox) experience. It allows for moderation and server administration in sandbox mode.<br/>
Since this mod provides a sandbox experience, it should be compatible with all of your previously installed mods (with minor exceptions).

<p align="center">
⚠️ This mod is not compatible with any other BeamJoy version. ⚠️<br/>
⚠️ Please ensure you removed any other version before running this mod. ⚠️
